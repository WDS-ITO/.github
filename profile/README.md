# World Data System International Technology Office

This is the GitHub home for the [WDS-ITO](https://wds-ito.org), an Interdisciplinary Body of the [International Science Council](https://council.science/). The WDS ITO was formed in late 2018 with the mission to build trustworthy and enduring global research data infrastructure for the public good. To that end, code that we write is open-source, and will (mostly) live here.
